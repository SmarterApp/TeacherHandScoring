# TeacherHandScoring
The Teacher Hand Scoring system supports scoring, by teachers, of **hand-scored items** on **interim** tests.

Source code for the Teacher Hand Scoring system is located at [https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss](https://bitbucket.org/sbacoss). This is a placeholder repository primarly for the purpose of collecting issues (bug reports and enhancement requests) that will guide development starting in July 2015.
